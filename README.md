Project 3 - Mobile App Dev

Hybrid App

I created a hybrid mobile app using Cordova. I created a one page web app that displays various information in a dashboard style navigation pane. 

The app is called "Map Me!" and will retrieve and display the temperature, altitude, humidity, and details of the selected location. 

Cordova Plugin: Geolocation Plugin

Third Party APIs: OpenWeatherMap API (temperature, humidity), Google Maps API (altitude, geocoding)
